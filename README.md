# datamining-tp02
In this TP we will develop the full **supervised learning pipeline** including the hyper-parameter tuning and model evalutaion.

We will then apply the pipeline to three algorithms
1. nearest neighbour
2. decision tree
3. default classifier

Finally, we will perform model comparison and discuss its results.
